Pixtract - email photos to your site!

The premise of Pixtract is simple: email photos (and other media) to an IMAP account,
then have your server periodically check the inbox for new messages and download
attachments if the message contains a secret passphrase (to avoid CRAX0R attacks).

A server-side .json file is updated with the paths to your recent uploads, and
can be queried via client-side javascript to show off your lovely media.

Requirements: ImageMagick + Python bindings for resizing + an IMAP account.
